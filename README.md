## Software Developer 

I design and code skillfully, so that you don't have to.

### Hi, my name is Cheyanne.  Nice to meet you.

Since beginning my journey as a business analyst nearly 5 years ago, I have been working with software but did not really understand "how" software works.  So in 2018, I decided to get the full picture by becoming a student at The Tech Academy coding bootcamp.  Through many hours of victories and frustrating learning curves, I have improved my software knowledge by leaps and bounds!  My experience and hard work have built my coding confidence, increased my natural curiosity, and have amped my software chops.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/crolfsson/crolfsson.github.io-Cheyanne-Rolfsson/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
